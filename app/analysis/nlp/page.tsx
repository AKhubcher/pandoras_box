    description: "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) is a multimodal large language model trained and created by OpenAI and the fourth in its series of GPT foundation models. It was launched on March 14, 2023, and made publicly available via the paid chatbot product ChatGPT Plus, via OpenAI's API, and via the free chatbot Microsoft Copilot. As a transformer-based model, GPT-4 uses a paradigm where pre-training using both public data and 'data licensed from third- party providers' is used to predict the next token. After this step, the model was then fine-tuned with reinforcement learning feedback from humans and AI for human alignment and policy compliance",

    name: "BERT",
    description: "BERT is a bidirectional transformer pretrained on unlabeled text to predict masked tokens in a sentence and to predict whether one sentence follows another. The main idea is that by randomly masking some tokens, the model can train on text to the left and right, giving it a more thorough understanding. BERT is also very versatile because its learned language representations can be adapted for other NLP tasks by fine-tuning an additional layer or head",
